## Summary:
Working with Dr. Arturo Hernandez and Dr. John McCall in black-box optimization methods. I analyzed population based algorithms that employ probabilistic models to guide the search process and that are built upon the Information Geometry (IG) framework. Our goal was to introduce a novel global optimization algorithm.

## Research output:
- Research stay in the Computational Intelligence Group at Robert Gordon University, UK.
- Graduated of the CIMAT CS MS program with the thesis [A Univariate Boltzmann based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Using the Natural
Gradient for Updating the Parameters](https://cimat.repositorioinstitucional.mx/jspui/handle/1008/484)
