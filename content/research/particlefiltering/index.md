## Summary: 
In my BS thesis I studied the main principles behind evolutionary algorithms and in particular, metaheuristics such as Particle Swarm Optimization. The purpose of this research was to develop hybrid approaches together with the particle filter method (PF) applied to the video object tracking problem.

We developed a color-based observation model and a linear transition model to use it in the canonical PF. Then a dynamic optimization step was combined with the PF to enhance the state estimation over time. Our appoach showed competitive performance w.r.t particle filters on complex benchmarks used in literature.

# Application to computational chemistry
## Summary
In my senior year as an undergrad student at Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico-Veracruz I did research in combinatorial optimization. The goal was to tackle the chemical equation balancing problem by using exact and metaheuristic methods. I contributed by implementing algebraic methods based on matrix computations and metaheuristics using object-oriented-programming in Java. We collected a dataset for testing this problem and presented the experimental results in a local conference on optimization and software.
