Working with â€‹Prof. Arturo Hernandez and Prof. John McCall in black-box optimization methods. I analyzed population based algorithms that employ probabilistic models to guide the search process and that are built upon the Information
Geometry (IG) framework. Our goal was to introduce a novel global optimization algorithm.
