I am a computer scientist who is passionate about the interplay between mathematical theory of intelligent systems, computational algorithms and their applications to solve real world problems.

I have research experience in combinatorial optimization working with [Dr. Rafael Rivera](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?hl=en&user=UoFV9LAAAAAJ) at TecNM - Veracruz, probabilistic modeling and evolutionary computation with [Dr. Arturo Hernandez](https://www.cimat.mx/~artha/) at [CIMAT, Mexico](http://pcc.cimat.mx/) and computational intelligence and machine learning with [Dr. John McCall](https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john) at [RGU, UK](http://www.comp.rgu.ac.uk/computational-intelligence-research-group/). 

Amazed to see how basic research is transformed into technology I started my professional career in the financial industry as a Quant developer and now as a Software Engineer in the tech sector. I am skilled in C++, C#, Python and modern software engineering best practices.
